    <description>The Account Engagement grade is based on how well a prospect fits your organization&apos;s ideal customer profile. Explicit factors such as company size, industry, job title and more help determine this value. A combination of grade (explicit) and score (implicit) can be used to very effectively optimize the sales team&apos;s time. Grade, like score, is calculated within the Account Engagement system and cannot be edited in Salesforce.com.</description>
